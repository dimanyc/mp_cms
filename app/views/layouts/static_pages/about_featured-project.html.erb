    Featured Project: Arnica
  </h2>
  <p>
    Arnica is a collaboration between Laura Coombs and Robert Lee Brackett III.  We create Arnica objects through our interest in translating biological forms into rich materials on an intimately wearable human scale.  We search for novel creations by combining digital technologies with traditional craft, merging digital organic modeling, 3D printing, and CNC machining with lost wax casting, rare metal alloys, and detailed hand finishing.  At the core of Arnica is our shared curiosity to understand and transform organic form into material beauty.
